# Template responses for CONFLICT messages
# NEVER use AI for these - always use safe template

templates:
  - "Sorry yaar, I know I've been distracted. Let's talk properly when I'm back?"
  - "I can see you're upset. Let me call you in a bit?"
  - "You're right, I should've done that. Sorry 🙏"
  - "Fair point. Let me respond to this properly myself in a few minutes"
  - "I hear you. Can we talk about this properly soon?"

# Default fallback
default: "I can see this is important. Let me respond to this myself in a bit."
